# Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja, Second Edition

## Why This Book?

I picked this one up (yes, a physical copy! I know!) while it was on sale on Amazon for
  <$20. The book was rewritten in 2016 to reflect the changes in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), the current JavaScript standard, and includes some best practices for JavaScript TDD.

Personally, I really enjoy working in a JavaScript development environment. The language
  provided some initial frustrations, but after taking a few weeks to work my way through
  the documentation, the pieces started to come together and I started to get
  a **deeper** understanding of the standard application lifecycle. And while I feel 
  comfortable working in a JavaScript ecosystem, I still lack the confidence to apply
  for JavaScript jobs. If I can work through this book and either already
  understand the bulk of the topics covered or am able to pick up new topics quickly
  and smoothly, I'll feel ready to apply for JavaScript development jobs.

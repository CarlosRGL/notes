## About

Notes & personal thoughts as I work through the Angular 2 documentation are stored 
  here.
  
The [tutorial folder](./tutorial_tour_of_heroes/) contains the source code for the 
  [Tour of Heroes](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial/) tutorial from 
  the official Angular 2 documentation, but all notes from the tutorial will be 
  stored here. Tutorial is up to date as of Angular 2.2.1 (2016-11-17)

The [guide folder](./guide/) contains notes about the
  [Official Angular 2 Guide](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/) and is
  organized in a similar manner, though not all sections of the guide will have
  notes to along with it. What notes am I supposed to provide for the Change Log?
  Seriously.

**DISCLAIMER**: These are **personal thoughts** on topics which in no way relate to 
  programming, and are primarily a collection of would-be philosophical ravings of 
  a 20-something with no knowledge of philosopy. I have no intentions for these to be,
  _in any way_, professional. And I don't care about your opinions on my opinions, so uh,
  write your own damn notes. Write me an open letter on Medium. I don't care.

Woooo yeah these are pointless. GitHub is a good way to store stuff, and 'thoughts'
  qualify as stuff. So. There's that.

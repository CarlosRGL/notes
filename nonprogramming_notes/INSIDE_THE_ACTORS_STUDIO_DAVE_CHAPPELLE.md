# Inside The Actors Studio With Dave Chappelle

> ...why are you taking notes on an interview show featuring a comedian?

I watch this episode pretty much every three months. If you want to see what honesty
  looks like, watch this interview. Dave Chappelle is an unbelievably intelligent 
  comedian and writer, and with his combination of story-telling talent and unabashed
  honesty he drops some of the most beautiful and needed advice that I think **everyone**
  could use.

No bullshit, folks.

## Interview Notes

> **Dave**: This kid - I still remember his name, Paul - we were coloring and...he was 
> coloring corn green and that really bugged me. And I told him that corn was yellow, and 
> he started hittin' me, and I was like 'this is the coldest shit that's ever happened to 
> me in my life!' It was like, instantly, life had changed...  
>
> **James**: So color was already an issue.

I really, really hope they come through with that buddy cop movie.



> **Dave**: Before I could tell time from a clock, I would tell time from the television. That
> I could turn on the television and see 'Oh this is on, it's 7:30'. I watched so much TV,
> man, I was always an escapist.

Loooool I used to tell time in India the same way. I could do complex division in the second
  grade, but for whatever reason we never learned how to read a clock? Also,
  Robin Williams also said he watched a lot of TV as an escape.

Dave Chappelle's affirmation that he would be a comedian came when he was in DC as a 
  teenager, and his mother brought home a TIME magazine with Bill Cosby on the cover.
  The headline was 'Cosby, Inc.' Before anyone gets all uppidy and stupid, this was
  _well_ before the recent allegations came forth. At this time, Bill Cosby was a
  **successful, intelligent, Black comedian**. Dave connected with the way Bill
  Cosby spoke and thought in respect to his comedy, and I assume he saw a path for himself.

Dave started going to comedy night clubs; weekends to see the comedians that worked, and Tuesdays
  to see the comedians that didn't. He studied. Being a comedian is far, far more than 'being
  funny.'



> **Dave**: A lot of white kids, you got things accessible to you, like...uh...therapy! We don't have that!
> We've got liquor stores, and weed!

Great joke, with a truth that does far more than sting. Like so many of Dave's jokes. The delivery
  creates a joke; the statement is just reality.



> _On the scene from 'Half Baked' with Thurgood and Sir Smokealot, both played by Dave_
>
> **Dave**: That's very embarrassing homie.
>
> **James**: I think it's a remarkable piece of acting...that's why I wanted to play it...
>
> **Dave:** I - I'm sorry man. For me, it's a little surreal, being on _The Actor's Studio_,
> and just to see you, like, '...and then you were on _Half Baked_'.



> _On Martin Lawrence_  
>
> **Dave:** We were doing 'Blue Streak', and we were promoting it, and Martin had a stroke!
> He almost died! And then after that I saw him, and I said 'Oh my God, Martin, are you okay?',
> and he said 'I got the best sleep I ever got in my life.' That's how tough he is. So let me
> ask you this...what is happening in Hollywood that a guy that tough will be in the middle
> of the streets, waiving a gun screaming 'They are trying to kill me!' What's going on?
> Why is Dave Chappelle going to Africa? Why does Mariah Carrey make a $100M dollar deal, and
> then take her clothes off on TRL? A weak person cannot get to sit here and talk to you. Ain't
> nobody weak talking to you! So what is happening in Hollywood? Nobody knows! 
>  
> **The worst thing you can call a person is crazy. It's dismissive. 'I don't understand this 
> person, so they're crazy', that's BULLSHIT. These people are not crazy. They're strong people.
> Maybe their environment is a little sick.**  



> _On Dealing With People Who Are Offended By Dave's Work_
>
> **Dave:** I think that America needs an honest discourse with itself. It's like...we're the 
> greatest country in the world...by default. But we could be the greatest country that ever
> existed, if we were just honest about who were are, and what we are, and where we want to 
> go, and if we learn how to have that discourse. Things like racism are institutionalized;
> it's systemic. You might not know any bigots. You feel like 'Well, I don't _hate_ Black
> people, so I'm not a racist!' But you benefit from racism, just by the merit of the color
> of your skin there are opportunities that you have - you're priviledged in ways you might
> not even realize because you haven't been deprived in certain ways. We need to talk about
> these things in order for them to change. 



> _Final Thoughts_  
>
> **Dave:** The truth is permanent; everything else will fall by the wayside.


## Inappropriate Times Audience Laughs

- **13:28:** Audience laughs when Dave mentions that his middle school no longer exists.
  I could be wrong, but I doubt a straight comment about the gentrification of his old
  neighborhood was meant to be taken as a 'haha' moment.

- **15:30:** Dave is talking about coming back to Washington, D.C. after a two-year period
  spent with his father in Yellow Springs, Ohio. 'While I was gone, crack had come out. It was
  like a...crack bomb went off.' Audience laughs. A teenager coming back to seeing 
  his neighborhood being destroyed by crack-cocaine is funny? There are even giggles when
  he mentions how many people were selling drugs, and what that must mean for how many people
  were **buying** drugs. People need to think.
